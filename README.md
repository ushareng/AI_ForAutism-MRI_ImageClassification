This example uses structural and resting state MRI data for Autism Classification .

Model : TensorFlow and Keras implementation of the paper 
[CASS: Cross Architectural Self-Supervision for Medical Image Analysis]([https://www.google.com](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04170v6.pdf))

Dataset : ABIDE is a collaboration of 16 international imaging sites that have aggregated and are openly sharing neuroimaging data from 539 individuals suffering from ASD and 573 typical controls. These 1112 datasets are composed of structural and resting state functional MRI data along with an extensive array of phenotypic information.
